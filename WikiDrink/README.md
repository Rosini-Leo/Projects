# Initialize the Application
To make the App work, you should run ```npm install``` in the directory of the project 
( using the CLI ), to use the project you have to manually install webpack and babel,
or use 'CRA' ```npx create-react-app``` and delete the two folders, src and public, replacing them with mine.


# Install the required libraries and run the Application in your localhost
First you have to register or login to __Formspree__
(in case you cannot use your own Back-end) and then create a new project called
'Cocktail Form' , once this is done , add the link that formspree will leave you
and add it to the action of the form in the __section Contact__ .
Once this is done you should install ```react-router-dom``` , ```styled-components``` and ```react-lottie```.
As a final step you need to run ```npm run start```, 
log into your favorite web browser and type __localhost:3000__ 
and you will be able to see the project!

## About the Application

This is my first open-source application that I made with: html, css and javascript.
I also use many libraries such as React, styled-system, styled-components, etc ...
**N.B**
Realizing by following a course of React.
I preferred to use my main language (Italian) for my first project,
however you can manually change the paragraphs by accessing the project! ðŸ˜‰
